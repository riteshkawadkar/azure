# This script performs three tasks:
# 1. Creating Organizational Units (OUs) from a CSV file
# 2. Creating Groups from a CSV file
# 3. Creating Users from a CSV file

# Task 1: Creating Organizational Units (OUs)
# Import Active Directory module for running AD cmdlets
Import-Module ActiveDirectory
  
# Store the data from ous.csv in the $ADOU variable. CSV template needs the following headers -> name, path

# Loop through each row containing OU details in the CSV file
foreach ($ou in $ADOU)
{

    $name = $ou.name
    $path = $ou.path

    # Create an Organizational Unit in the specified path
    New-ADOrganizationalUnit -Name $name -Path $path
} 

# Add a wait condition between tasks
Start-Sleep -Seconds 10

# Task 2: Creating Groups

# Import CSV containing group details
